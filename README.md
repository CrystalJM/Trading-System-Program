# Trading-System-Program
a program for an RPG style buying and selling system

goals for CS project 

i want to make a program that allows the user to purchase items and place
those items in their inventory. the user will start with a certain (or random)
amount of gold. 

there will be an shop inventory with items displayed, clicing them will place them
in the cart and the user will have the option to either buy the item or cancel the
purchase. buying will subtract the amount the item is priced for from their gold.
cancel will clear the shopping cart. once the item is bought it will go into the 
user's own inventory. 

the user will also have a certain amount of starting items which they can sell. 
selling them will increase the amount of gold they have.

if i have already accomplished these basics then i hope to add more functionality 
such as having the user start off with certain stats. HP, MP, ATK, and DEF. once 
items are in the inventory there will be a button that can equip or use items.
consumable items will be used up and non consumable items will be equiped to one of
3 slots. consumable items will raise either HP or MP or both depending on the item.
non consumables like weapons and armour will raise ATK and DEF accordingly.

i have plans for an easter egg or two, those are always fun. but thats the very last
bit, if all goes well and i have time an easter egg could be the cherry on top.
